## **How It Works**

The **Guessing Game** is a simple command-line game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

- **Random Number Generation**: The program uses Python’s `random.randint()` function to generate a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of each game.
- **User Input**: The player is prompted to enter a guess. Each time they enter a number, the program compares it to the generated number.
- **Hints**: If the player’s guess is too high or too low, the program gives them a hint to help them adjust their next guess.
- **Guess Counter**: The program counts the number of attempts the player makes until they guess the correct number.
- **Victory Message**: Once the player guesses the correct number, the program displays a congratulatory message showing the total number of guesses taken.

This game is a great exercise for beginners to learn about `while` loops, conditionals, and handling user input in Python.
